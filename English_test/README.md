There is a .exe in dictonary:dist, you can download it and "Phrase".
Then put them into the same dictionary and execute .exe.
Also you can make the special words test by your self.

You need to put new words in this format:
    xxxx(en)_xxx(ch)、(means next words) just like: 
    apple_蘋果、banana_香蕉、ice cream_冰淇淋、..... and so on
